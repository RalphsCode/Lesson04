Lesson 4 - GIT

- What git command creates a branch?
	git branch   - for example: git branch new_branch
	
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
	A fast-forward merge is a straightforward merge where git applies all the changes in sequence.
	A recursive merge is used when git determines there are conflicting merges, and it combines the changes.

- What git command changes to another branch?
	git checkout is used to change into another branch.
	
- What git command deletes a branch?
	git branch -d branch_name  is used to delete a branch.
	
- How do merge conflicts happen?
	Merge conflicts happen when attempting a commit and there is more than one branch with changes to  
	file(s), or, the  master version of the file has been changed, and the merge has a conflict and does not
	know which version should be used.
